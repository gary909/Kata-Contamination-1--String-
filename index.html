    <p>
        An AI has infected a text with a character!!<br>
<br>
        This text is now fully mutated to this character.<br>
<br>
        If the text or the character are empty, return an empty string.<br>
        There will never be a case when both are empty as nothing is going on!!<br>
<br>
        Note: The character is a string of length 1 or an empty string.<br>
<br>
        Example<br>
        text before = "abc"<br>
        character   = "z"<br>
        text after  = "zzz"<br>
    </p>
